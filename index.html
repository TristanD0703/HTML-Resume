                Hi, my name is Tristan Desoto. I am currently a rising Sophomore of Louisiana State University. Almost
                all my life I have been interested in pursing Computer Science in some capacity. I aspire to live up
                to that dream of becoming a computer programmer. 
                </p>
                <p>
                This all would not have happened if I haven't been introduced to computers through video games. In fact,
                I am currently a competitive video game player for a game called Splatoon 3. I am the captain of a team 
                called Benthic Brigade, and we have risen to be a very well known contender in our league.
                </p>
                <p>
                All of these attributes have given me the experience of a leader, team player, dedicated worker, 
                and the drive to learn, even if that means I will fail.
                </p>
